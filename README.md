# Nand2Tetris
My Nand2Tetris Journey :)

Building a full fledged computer system to play tetris, starting from the most basic component: NAND gates

I started this project in early Dec 2024 because I really wanted to understand how computers actually do anything with 1's, 0's and transistors.

I've really enjoyed the course so far and it has done so much to solidify my understanding of concepts learned in my
digital systems, computer architecture, and microprocessor interfacing courses from my computer engineering undergrad.

PROJECTS
Project 1:
- Construct NAND gate with relays
- Construct basic 1-16 bit logic gates using NAND gates
    - Not, And, Or, Xor, Mux, DeMux
- Write Hack HDL for each logic gate

Project 2:
- Construct Arithmetic and Logic unit components using basic 1-16 bit logic gates
    - Half/Full Adder, Multibit Adder, Increment, Logic Unit, Arithmetic Unit, Complete ALU
- Write Hack HDL for ALU and each component of ALU

Project 3:
- Construct combinational and sequential Memory components using basic 1-16 bit logic gates
    - SR/D Latches, Data Flip-Flop, 1-16 bit Registers, Counter, RAM
- Write Hack HDL for RAM/Memory components

Project 4:
- Develop two programs in HACK CPU machine language
- Fill.asm scans for keyboard input, if true then screen is set black, if no input then screen clears back to white
- Mult.asm multiplies two inputs (held in R0 and R1) and places product in R2
